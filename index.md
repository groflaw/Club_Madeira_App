## Get Started
### macOS
1. Download **Club Madeira QR Scanner** from the Mac App Store.
2. Launch the app and click **"Scan QR Code"**.
3. Grant **Screen Recording** permission when prompted by macOS.
4. QR codes on your screen will be automatically highlighted.
5. Click any highlighted QR code to access the partner website.

> The app requires Screen Recording permission to detect QR codes on your screen. This permission is only used for QR code detection and nothing else.

## Permissions (Why macOS asks)
macOS shows a permission request for **Screen Recording** because the app needs to:
- **Capture your screen** temporarily to detect QR codes
- **Highlight detected QR codes** for easy identification
- **Process QR code data** to extract website URLs

No personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted. The app only processes QR codes visible on your screen.

## How It Works
1. **Start Scanning** - Click "Scan QR Code" to begin screen monitoring
2. **Auto-Detection** - QR codes anywhere on your screen are automatically found and highlighted
3. **Click to Access** - Click any highlighted QR code to instantly open the partner website
4. **Secure Verification** - All partner websites are verified before opening
5. **Save for Later** - Verified websites are saved for quick future access

## Troubleshooting
