## Overview

The Club Madeira App is a cross-platform application available on **iOS, macOS, and Android** that scans QR codes and provides instant access to Club Madeira partner websites. On **macOS**, the app detects QR codes displayed on your screen. On **iOS and Android**, the app scans QR codes using your device's camera. This privacy policy explains how the app operates and what data it handles across all supported platforms.

## What This App Does

  - **macOS**: Automatically detects and highlights QR codes displayed anywhere on your screen
  - **iOS/Android**: Scans QR codes using your device's camera
- **Website Access**: Provides instant access to verified Club Madeira partner websites

- **No tracking cookies**
- **No analytics data**
- **No screen content beyond QR code detection**

### ✅ What We DON'T Store

## How It Works

1. **QR Code Detection**: 
   - **macOS**: App temporarily captures your screen to detect QR codes
   - **iOS/Android**: App uses your device's camera to scan QR codes
2. **QR Code Processing**: Processes QR codes locally to extract URLs
3. **Website Verification**: Verifies partner websites for security
4. **Local Access**: Opens verified websites directly in your browser
5. **Local Storage**: Saves verified URLs locally on your device

## Permissions Required

The app requires different permissions depending on your platform:

- **macOS**: Screen Recording permission (to detect QR codes displayed on your screen)
- **iOS**: Camera permission (to scan QR codes using your device's camera)
- **Android**: Camera permission (to scan QR codes using your device's camera)

These permissions are required to:
- Detect or scan QR codes (from screen on macOS, from camera on iOS/Android)
- Highlight detected QR codes for easy identification
- Process QR code data to extract website URLs

**Important**: 
- **macOS**: The app only captures screen content temporarily for QR code detection. No screen content is stored, transmitted, or saved.
- **iOS/Android**: The app only uses your camera to scan QR codes. No camera footage, photos, or videos are stored, transmitted, or saved. The camera is used only when you actively use the QR scanning feature.

### Data Collection Details

**What We Collect:**

*macOS:*
- Temporary screenshots of your display (only when QR scanner is active)

  - **iOS**: Apple's Vision framework (processes camera feed)
  - **Android**: Android QR code detection libraries (processes camera feed)
- Extract URLs or text content from QR codes
- Display visual highlights over detected QR codes
- Verify partner website URLs before opening

**Data Processing:**

- **macOS**: Screenshots are immediately discarded after QR code detection
